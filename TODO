---- Main Page ----
Should contain total statistics: 
- Best list    (Highest Ranking) (Per Person) (And Together)
- Best Artist  - || -
- Best Song    - || -
- Highest Number of lists per year
- Highest number of songs per year
- Number of lists for each year
---- Ranking ----
Rank method 1: (Most Voted)
Every song on a list gets a vote, position does not matter

Rank Method 2: (Highest Ranked)
Songs higher in a list gets more points


---- Website Design ----
Main page should only contain statistics shown above.
Then a navbar to each year

At each years webpage a stat view for just that year.
and then the list should follow

on the year page the lists should be display next to each other, like this:
<Date>
<Ante>            <Roy>
1.                1. 
2.                2.
3.                3.
4.                4.
5.                5.

Maybe some kind of tooltips on artist / songs that have many votes / high ranking.


---- A Ranking Page ----- (Maybe)
the ranking page should explain the ranking system and show the list with most votes and highest rank.



---- Write a basic md to json converter in C# ----
to do some statistic calculation we need the data to be in json
should be so simple it is only applicable to my year files
